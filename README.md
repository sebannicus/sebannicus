ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @sebannicus  
ðŸ’» Iâ€™m a recently graduated Higher-Level Technician in Programming Analysis from INACAP, passionate about technology and software development.  
ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in becoming a great developer and turning my ideas into real, innovative projects!  
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m skilled in backend development with Python and Django, and frontend with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. I also work with SQL and NoSQL databases like MongoDB, database modeling, and business process modeling (BPMN). Iâ€™m familiar with agile methodologies like sprints and committed to delivering secure and high-quality software.  
ðŸš€ Iâ€™m currently learning more about full-stack development and building projects for my portfolio!  
ðŸ“« How to reach me: Send me a message and Iâ€™ll get back to you! :)  
ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: Seba :D  
âš¡ Fun fact: Iâ€™m super curious, love to learn new things, and I talk a lot â€” in a fun way!
